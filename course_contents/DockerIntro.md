# Docker Introduction

Docker is a handy management tool to build, run and share container images.

Docker is widely used in bioinformatics because it addresses several challenges that are common in this field:

- Reproducibility
- Portability
- Sofware dependency management
- Scalability
- Collaboration
- Version control of environments
- Integration with other bioinformatics tools (e.g. Nextflow)

These container images can be uploaded and published in a centralized repository known as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), or hosted by other parties, such as [Quay](https://quay.io/).
